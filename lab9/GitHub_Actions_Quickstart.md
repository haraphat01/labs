## GitHub Actions 
GitHub Actions is a powerful tool that allows you to automate your software development workflows. With GitHub Actions, you can build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. I will set up a simple workflow that runs a Python script on every push to the main branch of a repository.

## Setting up a Workflow
To set up a workflow, I need to create a .github/workflows directory in our repository and add a YAML file inside it. The YAML file describes the workflow and its jobs. Here's an example YAML file that runs a Python script:

```yaml
name: Python Script

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  run-script:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.1'
      - name: Run Python Script
        run: python script.py
        
```
## Observing Workflow Execution
To observe the workflow execution, we need to push some changes to our repository. Let's create a simple Python script called script.py:

I added this file to the repository and push it to the main branch. After a few seconds, the workflow start running in the Actions tab of our repository.

If everything goes well, the workflow should complete successfully and we should see a green checkmark next to it. We can click on the workflow to see more details, including the output of each step. In this case, we should see the output "Hello, GitHub Actions!".

If there are any errors or failures, we'll see a red X next to the workflow. We can click on the workflow to see the error message and debug the issue.

## Gathering System Information and Manual Triggering

## Manual Trigger
To enable a manual trigger in the workflow, I need to add a new workflow_dispatch event to the YAML file. Here's an updated YAML file that includes a manual trigger:

```yaml
name: Python Script

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  run-script:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.1'
      - name: Run Python Script
        run: python script.py
        
```
I added a new workflow_dispatch event, which allows us to manually trigger the workflow from the GitHub Actions UI. We can now go to the Actions tab of our repository, select our workflow, and click on the "Run workflow" button to manually trigger the workflow.

## Gathering System Information
To gather system information, I can use the setup-latest action provided by GitHub. This action sets up the latest version of the runner, and provides information about the runner, hardware specifications, and operating system details. I can add a new step to our YAML file to run this action:

```yaml
name: Python Script

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  run-script:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'
      - name: Gather System Information
        uses: actions/setup-latest@v2
      - name: Run Python Script
        run: python script.py
        
```

## Observing Workflow Execution

After making the above changes, I need to push the updated YAML file to the main branch of the repository. Then I can either wait for the push event or manually trigger the workflow using the "Run workflow" button in the Actions tab.

When the workflow runs, I should see the output of the Gather System Information step in the logs. This will include information about the runner, hardware specifications, and operating system details. We can use this information to debug any issues that may arise during our workflow execution.
