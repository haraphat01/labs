## Serverless Computing Platform Research
Serverless computing platforms are cloud computing services that allow developers to run applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. In this research task, I explore the best serverless computing platforms provided by three major cloud service providers: AWS, GCP, and Azure.

## AWS Serverless Computing Platforms
## AWS Lambda
1. AWS Lambda is a fully-managed serverless computing platform that allows developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
2. Supports popular programming languages like Node.js, Python, Java, and .NET.
3. Can be integrated with other AWS services like S3, DynamoDB, and API Gateway for building serverless applications.
4. Provides automatic scaling and pay-per-use pricing model for cost efficiency.

## AWS Fargate
AWS Fargate is a serverless computing platform that allows developers to run Docker containers without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.
Provides automatic scaling and pay-per-use pricing model for cost efficiency.
Supports integration with other AWS services like ECS and EKS for easy deployment and management.

## GCP Serverless Computing Platforms
## Cloud Functions
C1. loud Functions is a fully-managed serverless computing platform that allows developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
2. Supports popular programming languages like Node.js, Python, Go, and Java.
3. Can be integrated with other GCP services like Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, and Firebase for building serverless applications.
4. Provides automatic scaling and pay-per-use pricing model for cost efficiency.

## Cloud Run
1. Cloud Run is a serverless computing platform that allows developers to run containerized applications without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.
2. Provides automatic scaling and pay-per-use pricing model for cost efficiency.
3. Supports integration with other GCP services like Cloud Build and Cloud Logging for easy deployment and management.

## Azure Serverless Computing Platforms
## Azure Functions
Azure Functions is a fully-managed serverless computing platform that allows developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers.
Supports popular programming languages like C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python.
Can be integrated with other Azure services like Event Grid, Cosmos DB, and Blob Storage for building serverless applications.
Provides automatic scaling and pay-per-use pricing model for cost efficiency.

## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) with Virtual Nodes
1. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that allows developers to deploy and manage containerized applications.
2. Virtual Nodes is a feature of AKS that allows for serverless computing by auto-scaling and provisioning nodes as needed.
3. Provides automatic scaling and pay-per-use pricing model for cost efficiency.
